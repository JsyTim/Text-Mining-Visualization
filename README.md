Siyuan Jiang worked on the Geospaital visualization.

Jie Li worked on the Network visualization.

Roberto Gomez Pomares worked on the Text Visualization.

We used leaflet d3, bootstrap and Highscharts libraries for this project.


### Dataset

We used a dataset extension of Movieslens10M, which carries a lot of information of over 10,000 movies from around the world in a span of about of around 90 years. The datasets have info such as the name of the movies, the countries they are from, year of release, genres, actors, directors, etc.


### Features
What we want to do with our project is show a world map with a slider where you can choose a year and the map will show where the movies are from. The network visual would show movies of that year and show which genres of movies they are. When clicking on the movies on the network will bring a word cloud that shows the common tags used by users on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes for that movie. There would also be other word clouds when a year and a country is selected that would show the common genres, actors and directors of that specific year and country. Due to the high amount of actors in the dataset, the actors were limited to only 300 at most per year.

This way, users can see which movies are from what countries, what were the most common genres of the movies and the common actors and directors based on years and countries.
